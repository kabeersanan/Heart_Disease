This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a binary classification model built with Logistic Regression. Utilizing the Framingham Heart Study dataset, which includes key patient health indicators such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and smoking habits, the model was trained to assess cardiovascular risk with an accuracy of 87%. The goal is to enable early detection and proactive intervention by classifying patients as high or low risk for developing heart disease. Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation were carried out using Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, all within a Jupyter Notebook environment. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in public health by offering a lightweight yet effective tool for preliminary heart disease screening.
